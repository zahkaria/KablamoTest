###Front-End test 3

###Instructions
You have 3 hours to complete as much as you can, we reccommend you focus on your areas of strength as we are expecting that you will not finish within 3 hours.

We want to understand how you've built the application, you may use any 3rd party libraries of your choosing, please highlight which ones you have chosen.

Please fork this repo to your personal Github account, and once complete allow us with access to your repo.

When submitting your test, please specify any tools you have used, including the editor you used to write your code, and the instruments used to test performance.

Acceptance criteria:
* Should be a web APP
* Using the data set found within dataset.xls, create a listview on the homepage containing the restaurant names
* TOUCHING an item on the list view will load a child view containing a map
* Drop a pin on the map using lat & lon of the POI
* The data MAY be uploaded and accessed via a web service, the server technology being of your choosing
* The map should center over the pins, at an appropriate zoom level to view all the pins
* The pins should have a popup that contains the description / title of the pin
* We'd like to see a CI system used to build and deploy this web APP, its of your choosing

###General requirements and considerations
Generally, you should build the web page in the way that you feel it should be built, however the following should be taken into consideration:

* Accessibility: 
Ensure that your mark-up takes into account basic accessibility standards. For example alt attributes and similar are set. Please also consider page weight.

* Standards compliance: 
Ensure that your mark-up is W3C compliant. For example, all tags are correctly closed, tags are nested correctly and that all necessary attributes for a tag are set. Your page should validate against the online W3C checker.

* Testability:
We care how testable your code is. We'd like to see consideration for testing frameworks used, and a strategy for how you'd structure and write tests.

* Dependency management:
We care how you manage assets and libraries, we'd like to see how you manage dependencies for this web app.

* SEO
We care how SEO friendly you app is. We'd like to see consideration for SEO, or a strategy / approach. e.g. Deep linking to content.

* Semantics: 
Ensure that your mark-up is semantic. For example, header tags are used where relevant, information follows a logical flow throughout the document and that information is displayed using the most appropriate tag.

* JavaScript:
Ensure you write neat, tidy JavaScript that you would consider suitable for a live web site.

* Frameworks:
We don't mind which frameworks you choose, though we hope you choose appropriate ones. 

* RWD: 
Ensure that your page renders 'appropriately' on a late model iPhone or Android, and Desktop browser.

* Flair:
This is a chance to show us how creative you can be, whether is animation, coding style, testability, low-level understanding, etc. We're interested to see what unique skills you may have.

* Browsers:
The page should function and resemble the creative in one of the following web browsers:
** Mobile Safari (latest)
** Mobile Google Chrome (latest)
